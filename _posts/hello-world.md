## About me
Hello world ;, my name is Miguel Vargas Valencia. I’m a Biology + Computer Science student at McGill who just finished a Barbados field semester studying how artificial breakwaters influence reef biodiversity. I pair those research chops with strong data-coding skills in Python and R, steady experience tutoring math & science, and two terms of civic work in the Quebec Youth Parliament. In short, I love turning curiosity into impact—whether that’s crunching ecological data, mentoring students, or shaping tech-savvy policy.
