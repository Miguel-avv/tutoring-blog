## About me
Hello world ; my name is Miguel Vargas Valencia. I’m a Biology + Computer Science student at McGill who just finished a Barbados field semester studying how artificial breakwaters influence reef biodiversity. I pair those research chops with strong data-coding skills in Python and R, steady experience tutoring math & science, and two terms of civic work in the Quebec Youth Parliament. In short, I love turning curiosity into impact—whether that’s crunching ecological data, mentoring students, or shaping tech-savvy policy.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Biology and Computer Science at McGill University, where I merge life-science insight with solid programming skills in Python, R, Java, and JavaScript. My academic record—highlighted by a 32.5 R-score and repeated honours distinctions—reflects a strong commitment to excellence. I have conducted field research in Barbados on the ecological impact of coastal breakwaters, and I regularly tutor mathematics and science to students in grades 6-11. My leadership experience includes two sessions in the Quebec Youth Parliament, where I most recently sponsored a motion on the responsible integration of artificial intelligence in schools. Professional roles ranging from camp counselor to elections receptionist have strengthened my communication and teamwork abilities.
