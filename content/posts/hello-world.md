# About me

Hello world, my name is Miguel Vargas Valencia. Iâ€™m a 21-year-old McGill student, double-majoring in Computer Science and Biology here in Quebec.

Last semester was a whirlwind: I wrapped up a Barbados coastal-research field term, dove into probability theory, cryptography, and a BIOL 310 project on breakwater analysis.
